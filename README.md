## User Story
 AS a D&D fan
I want to to learn more about the fantasy world, be able to make a random character, and find the nearest game/hobby store
SO that I can start playing D&D and other table top games

It is done:
* WHEN I go to the landing page
* THEN I am greeted with a navbar that can navigate to different parts of the webpage, welcome message, and two buttons, one to roll a dice and one to display a random spell title and description.
* WHEN I click the “Create a Character” option in the navbar
* THEN I am taken to another page with a section that requires user-input to create and display the character description
* WHEN I click the “Game Store Locations” option in the navbar
* THEN I am taken to another page where I can see the local game stores around San Diego
