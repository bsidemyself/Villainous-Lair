## User Story
 AS a D&D fan
I want to to learn more about the fantasy world, be able to make a random character, and find the nearest game/hobby store
SO that I can start playing D&D and other table top games

It is done:
* WHEN I go to the landing page
* THEN I see a welcoming layout in the fantasy style
* WHEN I click on the LORE button
* THEN I'm presented with a item, monster, or spell from the D&D universe
* WHEN I click on the create character button
* THEN I am taken to another page where I can use a random character generator
* WHEN I click the hobby store locater button
* THEN I am taken to a page where the user can search for hobby stores based on zip code
